# Sinatra-Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for creating web apps with [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com). This boilerplate is meant to be 
cloned with the [boilerplate](http://ajaymt.github.com/boilerplate) tool.

## Cloning
Clone it with [boilerplate](http://ajaymt.github.com/boilerplate).

```sh
$ boilerplate sinatra <project-name>
```

Or just `git-clone` it.

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/AjayMT/sinatra-boilerplate.git
```

## Running
Install the necessary gems. Do this **only once**, since you don't need to install dependencies every time you run 
your app.

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Then you can run it via bundler.

```sh
$ bundle exec ruby @name@.rb
```
