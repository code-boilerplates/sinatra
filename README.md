# Sinatra-Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for creating web apps with [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com). This boilerplate is meant to be 
cloned with the [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp) tool.

## Cloning
Clone it with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp).

```sh
$ bp sinatra <project-name>
```

Or just `git-clone` it.

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/code-boilerplates/sinatra-boilerplate.git
```

## Running
Install the necessary gems. Do this **only once**, since you don't need to install dependencies every time you run 
your app.

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Then you can run it via bundler.

```sh
$ bundle exec ruby @name@.rb
```
